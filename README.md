These are scripts that I have used in my machine learning projects. Because of the proprietary nature of the work I have done, not all actual production scripts have been shared. The shareable version presented here are far more simple compared to the actual versions I have used. However, these shared versions do present the overall structure of what I have built and should give a good sense of what I have accomplished thus far.

Also, the are many additional support scripts I have written for the purposes of cleaning data and running sql queries. Again, because of their proprietary nature I was not able to share them. Here is a list of these other scripts I have used but have not yet prepared in a shareable format yet. This could be consider a form of a to-do list for me:

- Factor Analysis
- Principle Component Analysis
- Clustering
- Web Scraping
- Statistical Significance Tests
- Various Data Visualizations
- Various Data Cleaning Scripts
- AWS Cloud Formation Templates
- MySQL Queries
