This are scripts that I have used in my machine learning projects. Because of the proprietary nature of the work I have done not all actual production scripts have been shared. The shareable version presented here are likely far more watered down compared to the actual ones I have used.

Also, the are many additional support scripts I have written for the purposes of cleaning data and running sql queries. Again, because of their proprietary nature I was not able to share them.

Here is a list of other scripts I have used but have not yet prepared in a shareable format yet. This could be consider a form of a to-do list for me:
- Factor Analysis
- Principle Component Analysis
- Clustering
- Web Scraping
- Statistical Significance Tests
- Various Data Visualizations
- Various Data Cleaning Scripts
- AWS Cloud Formation Templates
- MySQL Queries
